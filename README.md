# 🌐 Jash Doshi — Interactive Web Portfolio

A **premium, scroll-driven personal portfolio** built to showcase creative engineering, motion design, and performance-focused frontend development.

This project goes beyond a traditional portfolio website. It delivers an **immersive scrollytelling experience** where animation, interaction, and content move together — creating a strong first impression and a memorable user journey.

## ✨ What Makes This Portfolio Unique

### 🎬 Scroll-Controlled Cinematic Hero
- A **240-frame animation** rendered on an HTML5 Canvas
- Frames are precisely synced to scroll position
- Feels like video, but with full scroll control and superior performance

This approach transforms scrolling into an interactive storytelling tool rather than simple navigation.

---

### 🌊 WebGL Fluid Cursor Interaction
- Real-time **fluid simulation** that reacts to cursor movement
- Built using **WebGL shaders** and GPU acceleration
- Subtle, immersive, and performance-aware

---

### 🎥 Motion-First Design Language
Every section is enhanced with purposeful motion:
- Text reveals with depth and blur
- Cards scale, stack, and tilt as you scroll
- Sections pin and transition smoothly

Animation is treated as **UX**, not decoration.

---

### 🌓 Premium Dark UI System
- Carefully tuned opacity-based typography
- Consistent design tokens across the entire site
- Glassy surfaces, gradients, and refined micro-interactions

Designed for long viewing sessions without visual fatigue.

---

### 🎭 Footer Reveal Experience
The footer sits **behind the main content** and reveals itself only at the end of the scroll — creating a polished, high-end finish to the experience.
